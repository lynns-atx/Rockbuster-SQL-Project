# Rockbuster Project
## Project Overview
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company with retail locations all around the world. They are planning to launch an online streaming platform, similar to Netflix and Amazon Prime. They want a series of business questions answered, such as: which movies contributed to the most/least revenue gain, what was the average rental duration for all videoes, which countries are Rockbuster customers based in, where are customers with a high lifetime value based, and do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
